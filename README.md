# TeleBot
A Telegram bot that sends 5 English words daily based on the person's current language skills to help users build vocabulary. 

## Why I built it
When studying English (as a non-native speaker) we are mostly taught grammar and language rules. However, to build good language skills we also need a solid vocabulary, which most of the times we have to build ourselves. Receiving relevant words daily and learning them can be a great addition to typical school lessons and/or tutoring sessions!

## Code
Code is completely written in Python, using relevant libraries including a Telegram library "telebot". To make code work, include your own bot token that you can get from Bot Father (here's a tutorial: https://gist.github.com/nafiesl/4ad622f344cd1dc3bb1ecbe468ff9f8a)

## Notes
Potential ways to build off this bot is to add interactive tasks, and handle user responses.
